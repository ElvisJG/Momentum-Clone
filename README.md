# Momentum Clone

Created following Brad Traversy's "Dynamic Landing Page" tutorial, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSTQzlprGLI.

This tutorial is extremely detailed, i'd highly recommend it.

Going to further expand on it with some styling and dynamic backgrounds/quotes. Saves name/tasks to local storage.
